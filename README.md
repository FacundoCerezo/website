# website - www.facundocerezo.com
Repository for my personal website and portfolio

## Guidelines
* It should be informative. It has to be a platform for showing off my portfolio and social media.
* It should look good.
* It should be fast and quick to load.
* It should be a playground to learn front-end development. The idea here is to try to learn new things like CSS-Grid to be able to apply them to my future projects.
* It should be responsive, because we are in 2020.

## Ideas
* Using a static website generator or HTML template helper.
* Storing projects on a database (probably SQL) or some json files.
* Learn how to use a view framework/library like Vue.js or React.
